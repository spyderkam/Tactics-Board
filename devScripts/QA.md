# Questions Asked and Answered

## What is the significance of `BLUE_TEAM = [pos[:] for pos in ORIGINAL_BLUE]` vs. just `BLUE_TEAM = ORIGINAL_BLUE`?

The significance of using `BLUE_TEAM = [pos[:] for pos in ORIGINAL_BLUE]` versus `BLUE_TEAM = ORIGINAL_BLUE` lies in how they handle mutable objects like lists.

### Shallow Copy vs Reference:

- `BLUE_TEAM = [pos[:] for pos in ORIGINAL_BLUE]` creates a new list where each element is a copy of the corresponding element from `ORIGINAL_BLUE`. This means you are creating a new instance of the list, and changes to the objects inside `BLUE_TEAM` won't affect `ORIGINAL_BLUE`, and vice versa.
- `BLUE_TEAM = ORIGINAL_BLUE` merely creates a reference to the same list. Any modification to `BLUE_TEAM` will directly affect `ORIGINAL_BLUE` since they both point to the same object in memory.

### Implications:

- If you want `BLUE_TEAM` to operate independently from `ORIGINAL_BLUE`, as would typically be the case if you're manipulating player positions and want to preserve the original formation for reuse, you need to use the first approach.
- Using the second approach might lead to unintended side effects if either list is modified later in the code.

### Example:

For intance, in a soccer game simulation, if `ORIGINAL_BLUE` holds the initial positions of the players, and during gameplay you want to update them in `BLUE_TEAM` while retaining the original positions for resetting or switching strategies, you would favor the first method.

Hereâ€™s an illustrative code snippet:
```python
# Original positions
ORIGINAL_BLUE = [[180, 540], [456, 360], [456, 540]]  # Example positions

# Creating a mutable copy
BLUE_TEAM = [pos[:] for pos in ORIGINAL_BLUE] 

# Now changes to BLUE_TEAM do not affect ORIGINAL_BLUE
BLUE_TEAM[0][0] = 200  # Move first player's position
print(ORIGINAL_BLUE)  # Still [[180, 540], [456, 360], [456, 540]]
print(BLUE_TEAM)      # Now [[200, 540], [456, 360], [456, 540]]
```

### In Summary
Creating a shallow copy: <br>
`BLUE_TEAM = [pos[:] for pos in ORIGINAL_BLUE]`

Creating a reference:: <br>
`BLUE_TEAM = ORIGINAL_BLUE`

## Why are some of the field lines being drawn in `main.py` and others in `server.py`?

The soccer field lines are drawn in both `main.py` and `server.py` because they serve different purposes in your application:

1. **In `main.py`**:
   - This file manages the core game logic and Pygame display. The lines representing the soccer field (outer boundaries, center line, penalty areas, and center circle) are drawn during each iteration of the main game loop within the Pygame rendering context. It is responsible for real-time visuals and player interactions.
   - This allows for dynamic updates based on user input, such as moving players or toggling the visibility of certain shapes.

2. **In `server.py`**:
   - This file handles the WebSocket server logic and manages network interactions between the frontend and backend. Although it contains the logic for updating formations and other states, it indirectly influences the drawing process by maintaining the game's state and sending necessary updates to clients.
   - It does not directly control the drawing of lines; rather, it sends data to the frontend, which updates the visual representation of the soccer field on the web page hosted by `tactics_board.html`.
