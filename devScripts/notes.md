# Notes

## Shape Tool Usage

After clicking on the tool, use it by clicking on the players to create the shape of interest. Once done, click on **Stop Tool** button. To create other shapes, make sure that the current shapes are all toggled off (you can toggle them all on once completed). To reset all tool, click on **Reset Tools** from the **Tool** dropdown menu.

## Issues

  - If player numbers are turned on, dragging is not optimized
  - Draggin is still very rough now that I am using it practically

## Future Upgrade

  - More formations to be added to the respective dropdown menus
  - A second and third line tool to be added
  - Ability to use other `Shape` tools without having to toggle off the current ones
  - Ability to change both team's colors with various options
    - As a consequences, toggle teams must be automated to left and right as apposed to color
