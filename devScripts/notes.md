# Notes

## Shape Tool Usage

After clicking on the tool, use it by clicking on the players to create the shape of interest. Once done, click on **Stop Tool** button. To create other shapes, make sure that the current shapes are all toggled off (you can toggle them all on once completed). To reset all tool, click on **Reset Tools** from the **Tool** dropdown menu.

## Issues

  - If player numbers are turned on, dragging is not optimized

## Future Upgrades

 - Ability to toggle off/on teams
 - More formations to be added to the respective dropdown menus
 - A second and third line tool to be added
 - Ability to use other `Shape` tools without having to toggle off the current ones
