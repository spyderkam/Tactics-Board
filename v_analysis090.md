# Beta Version Analysis (v0.9.0)

## Core Functionality:
- The main features (formations, player movement, shapes) are implemented and working
- Real-time synchronization is functional
- The UI is complete and usable

## Remaining Issues:
- Dragging performance issues, especially with player numbers enabled
- Some console errors with player team properties
- Shape tool interactions need refinement
- Mobile experience needs optimization

## Code Structure:
- The architecture is solid (separation of concerns between server/client)
- Error handling is implemented but needs enhancement
- Performance optimizations are identified but not yet implemented

## Conclusion:
This feels like a mature beta - the core product is there and working, but it needs polish and optimization before being considered v1.0. The issues are primarily about refinement rather than missing core functionality.

The program's current state suggests it's in late beta stage - usable but requiring final polish before a full release.
